# Switchy

> [!WARNING]
> At the moment, I have neither the time nor the inclination to support this program. If you have any issues with the stable version, you can try one of the preview builds in [this issue](https://github.com/erryox/Switchy/issues/14). Some bugs should be fixed in it, but there are other issues as well, which is why it’s a preview build. Feel free to fork this repo if you’d like to make any changes or improvements!

Switches keyboard layout with the Caps Lock key.

Just put [Switchy.exe](https://github.com/erryox/Switchy/releases/latest) in the startup folder (to open it press **Win+R** and type **shell:startup**).  
If you want to hide the pop-up in Windows 10/11, put in this folder a shortcut with **nopopup** parameter instead of the file itself.

> Note: for keyboard layout switching to work in programs running with administrator privileges, Switchy must also be run with administrator privileges. This can be automated using Task Scheduler.

Usage:
* **CapsLock** to change keyboard layout  
* **Shift+CapsLock** to toggle CapsLock state
* **Alt+CapsLock** to enable/disable Switchy
